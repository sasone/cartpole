This is the source code for the cartpole controller ANN. The code was developed in the year 1994 as part of the academic project for the engineering degree. Though the code follows the conceptual modularity in funtionality, it needs improvement in physical file modularity following the good practices of C and Header file organization. 

Put these files into the C:\TurboC3\Projects\cartpole directory.
Configure the Options > Directories in TurboC IDE to point to the right directories before compilation.
