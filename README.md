# cartpole
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Cart-pole controller

This was the college project executed as part of the Bachelor of Computer Science, National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru, 1994.

The project is based on the academic paper "Neuronlike Adaptive Elements That Can Solve Difficult Learning Control Problems", Andrew G. Barto, Richard S. Sutton, and Charles W. Anderson, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Vol. SMC-13, No. 5, September/October 1983.

# Development environment
The code was originally compiled using Turbo C on a x286 computer with DOS operating system.

To compile and execute this code you would require Turbo C compiler. You could use the TurboC available at https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/

# Note
This first version of the code has some bugs, introduced due to typing from the printed project report. This will need to be further reviewed and corrected.
