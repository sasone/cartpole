This directory contains the final build artefacts.

This EXE file is a 16bit DOS executable and can't be executed directly on a modern Windows environment. This can be executed in a DOSBox environment, which is included in the TurboC setup file in bin directory. 

The EGAVGA.BGI file is required to be present along with the EXE file so that it could use the Turbo C Borland Graphics Interface to do the graphics.
